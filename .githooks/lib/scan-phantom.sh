# scan-phantom.sh — the PHANTOM-COMPLETION family (Jev 70).
#
# WHAT IT CATCHES: a commit whose message claims completion or creation
# but whose diff is empty (no files changed), or that claims a file was
# created but the file does not exist in the pushed tree.
#
# ARTIFACT CLASS: a pushed commit range (the diff under inspection).
#
# USAGE: source this file, then call scan_phantom <commit_range>
#   commit_range: a git revision range (e.g. origin/main..HEAD)
#   Outputs one PHANTOM-DIFF:<sha>:<subject> line per hit, exit 0 always
#   (the caller decides whether to reject).

# scan_phantom <commit_range> — scan a commit range for phantom completions.
